This project aims to build a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques to suggest movies to users based on their preferences.

Steps
Data Collection: Gather movie ratings data from users, including movie IDs, user IDs, and ratings.
Data Preprocessing: Clean the data, handle missing values, and perform exploratory data analysis.
User-Item Matrix: Create a user-item matrix where rows represent users, columns represent movies, and entries represent ratings.
Collaborative Filtering: Implement collaborative filtering algorithms like User-Based or Item-Based methods.
Model Evaluation: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the recommendation system's accuracy.
Top-N Recommendations: Generate top-N movie recommendations for a specific user.
Interactive Interface: Create a simple web interface to allow users to input their preferences and receive movie recommendations.
Tech Stack
Python: Programming language used for the implementation.
pandas: Data manipulation library.
surprise: Library for building and analyzing recommender systems.
Flask or Django: Web framework for creating the interactive interface.
